===========================================================================

q105. What is Numerical Analysis?

NA is the union of theoretical and computational investigation into
the computer solution of mathematical problems.  NA generally includes
those problems involving continuous functions of real or complex
variables, as opposed to solely discrete variables and functions.

The mixing of theoretical and computational concerns leads to
a strong emphasis on algorithms:  what are the time and memory
usage properties of a certain algorithm?  What errors are introduced
by an algorithm?

The computational aspects of NA usually take place within
the scope of floating-point arithmetic, and are implemented on
machines ranging from super-computers through PCs to hand-calculators.
The theoretical aspects extend into fields such as Calculus,
Differential Equations, and Analysis.  The field of Linear Algebra
is so often used to model physical systems that the theoretical
study of Linear Algebra is in itself often considered to be
NA at work.

Primary areas of theoretical concern in NA are:
	* global/local error bounding
	* stability of algorithms
	* rates of convergence of algorithms

Primary areas of computational concern in NA are:
	* roundoff error
	* global/local error and its tolerance
	* time and memory requirements of computation
	* High Performance Computing (HPC)
	* parallel computing
	* architecture/platform specific details.

q110. Indices of NA Software on the Net

For indices of packages oriented towards symbolic algebra,
see q520, "Symbolic Algebra".


The NIST Guide to Available Mathematical Software (Formerly called GAMS)

http://gams.nist.gov/  NIST Guide to Mathematical Software
or telnet to: gams.nist.gov

[SJS]:
Maintained by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
An index and server for a wide variety of mathematical
software, including most of netlib (see q115.1, "Netlib").
Much of the software is in Fortran.  If you prefer to speak C++ or C,
see q160.1, "C++ Resources",
and q115.2, "Fortran, C, and f2c".

[Ronald Boisvert]:
The main focus is on fine-grained software components, e.g.
subroutines, although information about some larger packages are
included.  As of November 1995, nearly 10,000 components from more
than 90 packages have been cross-indexed using a detailed
tree-structured problem classification system.  Both freely available
software (from netlib or developed at NIST) and commercial packages
(used by NIST) are indexed, although source code is available only for
non-commercial software.

Some gems of netlib:

Machine/architecture dependent Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines
(BLAS) are the keystone of Netlib.

LAPACK, in Fortran 77, is the modern replacement
of EISPACK, LINPACK, etc.

CLAPACK is a C version of LAPACK.  See the Caution on
Using Arrays in q115.2, "Fortran, C, and f2c".

LAPACK++ is a C++ version of, sadly, only a subset of LAPACK.
LAPACK++ is work in progress, and hopefully the full
functionality of LAPACK will be supported soon.

ScaLAPACK is for distributed memory machines.




===================================


q115.2. Fortran, C, and the f2c Translator

For C++ and C resources, see q160.1, "C++ Resources".

Most of the programs in netlib are in Fortran.  However, netlib
contains an excellent Fortran-to-C conversion utility, f2c.
While f2c produces working C code, it is visually complex
and ugly.  Using f2c on a large package like LAPACK can require
a good deal of time to get all the options correct.
Fortunately, LAPACK has already be converted to C: see CLAPACK.

The utility f2c can also be invoked by email.  Send email
to netlib@research.att.com, with the subject "execute f2c",
and body containing the non-confidential Fortran program to be converted.
But the email option is of use only for very small, simple programs,
since a resulting C program of any size must be linked with the
f2c libraries.  Usually one will have to download the f2c package
anyway to generate the libraries.  Generally it's easier
to download the f2c package, build the libraries and the
f2c conversion program, and do the conversion locally.

CAUTION: Programs created by f2c conversion use parameter passing
conventions different from most C or C++ programs.  Their
callers must create the appropriate parameters before using them.
See the file f2c.ps in the f2c distribution.
A good description of this issue may also be found in
the "readme" file for clapack in netlib.

q115.3. Statlib

Statlib is a huge repository of statistics related software and info.
Probability, statistics, random variables, distribution functions.

q115.10. Java Numerical/Scientific Libraries

http://www.vni.com/products/wpd/jnl/jnl_1_0.html  Visual Numerics' Java package
[author]:
JNL, a Numerical Library for Java, is a set of classes for the most
important numerical functions missing in Java. The library is
comprised of one numerical type class, Complex, and three categories
of numerical functions classes: the special functions class, the    
linear algebra classes, and the statistics class. All classes use
double precision floating point as the underlying float type.


http://www.cs.utk.edu/f2j  JLAPACK
[author]:
The JLAPACK project provides the LAPACK and BLAS numerical subroutines 
translated from their Fortran 77 source into class files, executable by 
the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and suitable for use by Java programmers.
This makes it possible for a Java application or applet distributed on 
the web to use established legacy numerical code that was originally written 
in Fortran.  The translation was accomplished using a special purpose 
Fortran-to-Java (source-to-source) compiler.


http://www1.fpl.fs.fed.us/linear_algebra.html  Linear Algebra for Statistics Java Package




http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/  JAMA
[author]:
JAMA is a basic linear algebra package for Java. It provides user-level classes for constructing and manipulating real, dense
matrices.
Five fundamental matrix decompositions are provided:
     Cholesky Decomposition of symmetric, positive definite matrices 
     LU Decomposition (Gaussian elimination) of rectangular matrices 
     QR Decomposition of rectangular matrices 
     Eigenvalue Decomposition of both symmetric and nonsymmetric square matrices 
     Singular Value Decomposition of rectangular matrices 
Not Covered.  JAMA is by no means a complete linear algebra environment.  For example, there are no provisions for matrices with
particular structure (e.g., banded, sparse) or for more specialized decompositions (e.g. Shur, generalized eigenvalue).  Complex
matrices are not included.  It is not our intention to ignore these important problems.  We expect that some of these (e.g. complex) will
be addressed in future versions.  It is our intent that the design of JAMA not preclude extension to some of these additional areas. 




http://www.math.nist.gov/scimark  SciMark Java numerical benchmark
[author]:
The SciMark benchmark consists of various kernels (FFT, Monte Carlo, sparse
matrix computation, finite-difference stencils, and LU factorization)
and is meant to provide an indication of how well Java environments
perform on numeric and scientific applications.

SciMark can be run interactively within your browser, or downloaded
to run in other Java environments.  The web site includes bar-graph 
comparisons between various computer/Java platforms, as well
as an archive of previous results.

q115.12. PLAPACK: Parallel Linear Algebra

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/plapack  PLAPACK
[author]:
PLAPACK is an MPI based Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK)
designed to provide a user friendly infrastructure for building
parallel dense linear algebra libraries.
The Users' Guide, "Using PLAPACK: Parallel Linear Algebra Package" 
is available from The MIT Press.
WHAT IS DIFFERENT: PLAPACK provides three features not currently found
in other publically available parallel dense linear algebra libraries:
1) A matrix distribution that is a step towards one that is driven 
   by the natural distribution of an application, 
2) An application interface for filling and querying matrices and 
   vectors,
3) A programming interface that allows the code to be written in 
   a way that closely resembles the way algorithms are naturally
   explained, using object based (MPI-like) programming.

q120.1. Octave
http://www.che.wisc.edu/octave        Octave
ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave     Octave via ftp

[Dave Lindner]: Octave is considered the closest-to-Matlab
of the Matlab clones.

[author]:
Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for
numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line
interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems
numerically.

Octave can do arithmetic for real and complex scalars and matrices,
solve sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, integrate functions over
finite and infinite intervals, and integrate systems of ordinary
differential and differential-algebraic equations.

The Octave distribution includes a 200+ page Texinfo manual.
Two and three dimensional plotting is fully supported using gnuplot.

The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard
Fortran ones like Lapack, Linpack, Odepack, the Blas,
etc., packaged in a library of C++ classes.

===================================

q120.2. RLaB

http://www.eskimo.com/~ians/rlab.html   RLaB
ftp://csi.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/matlab/RLaB  RLaB via ftp
ftp://evans.ee.adfa.oz.au/pub/RLaB      RLaB via ftp in Australia

[author]:
Rlab is an interactive, interpreted scientific programming
environment. Rlab is a very high level language intended to provide
fast prototyping and program development, as well as easy
data-visualization, and processing.

Rlab is not a clone of languages such as those used by tools like
Matlab or Matrix_X/Xmath. However, as Rlab focuses on creating a good
experimental environment (or laboratory) in which to do matrix math,
it can be called "MATLAB-like" since the programming language
possesses similar operators and concepts.

===================================

q120.3. Scilab

http://www-rocq.inria.fr/scilab  Scilab
ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Scilab                  Scilab via ftp
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/scilab/  Scilib via ftp, USA
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/math/matrix  Scilib via ftp, USA

[Dave Lindner]: Scilab is another good Matlab clone.

[author]:
Scilab is a matrix-based scientific software package 
resembling Matlab-Simulink and Xmath-SystemBuild. 
Scilab contains hundreds of built-in mathematical 
functions, a rich set of data structures which includes
polynomials, rationals, linear systems, lists, sparse
matrices and comes with a number of specific toolboxes for 
control, signal processing, ...

It features:
Elaborate data structures (polynomial, rational and string
matrices, lists, multivariable linear systems,...).
Sophisticated interpreter and programming language with
Matlab-like syntax.
Hundreds of built-in math functions (new primitives can easily be
added).
Stunning graphics (2d, 3d, animation).
Open structure (easy interfacing with Fortran and C via online
dynamic link).

Many built-in libraries :
	* Linear Algebra (including sparse matrices, Kronecker
	form, ordered Schur,...).
	* Control (Classical, LQG, H-infinity, ...).
	* Signal processing.
	* Simulation (various ode's, dassl,...).
	* Optimization (differentiable and non-differentiable, LQ solver).
	* Metanet (network analysis and optimization).
Symbolic capabilities through Maple interface.

===================================

q120.4. Tela

http://www.geo.fmi.fi/prog/tela.html  Tela
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/sci/math/tela  Tela via ftp

General NA package with graphics, linear algebra, FFT, etc.
Is this another Matlab clone?

[author]:
It is mainly targeted for prototyping large-scale
numerical simulations and doing pre- and postprocessing for them, and
it replaces a compiled language like C++ or Fortran in this respect.
The feature set is therefore biased to operations needed in partial
differential equation solvers.

q120.7. Euler

ftp://am.ku-eichstaett.de/pub        Euler via ftp

[author]:
EULER started as a MatLab clone. It is now a program, which can handle 
real, complex and interval numbers and matrices, has a 2D/3D graphics, a 
builtin modern programming language (extension of MatLab's), an exact 
scalar product, and the Windows 95 version can call functions in an 
external DLL. The OS/2 and Windows versions interact nicely with the GUI, 
and have a notebook style interface.

The Unix version is free, the OS/2 version free for educational use, and 
the Windows version cheap shareware.

These features make EULER an ideal tool for the tasks such as
	* Inspecting and discussing functions of one real or complex
	variable.
	* Viewing surfaces in parameter representation.
	* Linear algebra and eigenvalue computation.
	* Testing numerical algorithms.
	* Solving differential equations numerically.
	* Computing polynomials.

[author]
Yorick is an interpreted language.  It has:
	* A C-like language, but without declarative statements.  Operations
	between arrays require no explicit loops, which accounts for
	Yorick's high speed.  Scientific computing and numerical analysis
	are the goals of most Yorick sessions.
	* An X window system interactive graphics package.
	* A library of functions written in the Yorick language.
Because Yorick can read either text or binary files, it can be used
"out of the box" as a pre- and post-processor for most existing
physics simulation programs.

As a pre-processor, you can write a Yorick program that produces
complicated input files for a simulation.  These might be based on
output from other programs, or might require evaluation of complicated
functions or involve a lot of repetition.

As a post-processor, Yorick allows you to compare the results of
several simulations or to analyze results of a single simulation in
ways you did not foresee when you ran it.

http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc.html  PETSc by www

[author]:
Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc).
   PETSc provides many tools for the parallel (and uniprocessor),
numerical solution of PDEs that require solving large-scale, sparse
nonlinear systems of equations.  PETSc includes nonlinear and linear
equation solvers that employ a variety of Newton techniques and Krylov
subspace methods. In addition, PETSc provides several parallel sparse
matrix formats, including compressed row, block compressed row, and
block diagonal storage.

   PETSc is fully usable from Fortran, C and C++, and runs portably on
on most UNIX systems.  PETSc uses MPI for all parallel communication.

   One of the unique features of PETSc is that it enables the
application programmer to easily and efficiently assemble parallel
vectors and sparse matrices.  Users can create complete application
programs for the parallel solution of nonlinear PDEs without writing
much explicit message-passing code themselves.

   In addition, PETSc is designed to facilitate extensibility.  Thus,
users can incorporate customized solvers and data structures when
using the package.

q120.13. Algae, formerly called Alki
http://www.eskimo.com/~ksh/algae/index.html  Algae home page

[author]:
Welcome to the home of Algae, a high-level interpreted language
for numerical analysis. Algae borrows from languages like MATLAB and
APL, but it was developed because we needed a free, efficient,
and versatile language capable of handling large problems. 

Algae is fast. It's generally faster than MATLAB, RLaB, and Octave,
often by a significant margin. Of course, words like "generally"
and "often" (and benchmarks themselves, for that matter) don't mean
much when it comes time to run your particular problem, and I'm
sure that you can find cases where Algae gets beat. Still, Algae is fast. 

Algae's arrays may be stored in sparse form; only the non-zero elements
and their locations are stored. This type of storage is required
for practical analysis in many fields. In my own field (structural
dynamics), a matrix with 20,000 rows and columns is not considered large.

q125. Commercial NA Libraries and Packages

Commercial libraries and packages tend to merge, so I've combined
them in one category.  Typically a commercial product contains:

	* graphics routines
	* an interactive interpreted language

Many symbolic algebra packages also contain NA packages.

[SJS]: Matlab is an interactive general NA package, including graphics.
A huge variety of "toolboxes" are available, both from the
vendor and on the net, for various specialized NA areas:
control systems, neural nets, optimization, symbolic math,
and on and on.
Simulink is modeling, simulation, and system analysis tool.

[author]:
MATLAB is a technical computing environment for high-performance
numeric computation and visualization. MATLAB integrates numerical
analysis, matrix computation, signal processing, and graphics in an
easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed
just as they are written mathematically - without traditional
programming.

MATLAB has evolved over a period of years with input from many users.
In university environments, it has become the standard instructional
tool for introductory courses in applied linear algebra, as well as
advanced courses in other areas. In industrial settings, MATLAB is
used for research and to solve practical engineering and mathematical
problems. Typical uses include general purpose numeric computation,
algorithm prototyping, and special purpose problem solving with matrix
formulations that arise in disciplines such as automatic control
theory, statistics, and digital signal processing (time-series
analysis).

MATLAB also features a family of application-specific solutions that
we call toolboxes. Very important to most users of MATLAB, toolboxes
are comprehensive collections of MATLAB functions (M-files) that
extend the MATLAB environment in order to solve particular classes of
problems. Areas in which toolboxes are available include signal
processing, control systems design, dynamic systems simulation,
systems identification, neural networks, and others.

SIMULINK is a tool for modeling, analyzing, and simulating an
extraordinarily wide variety of physical and mathematical systems,
including those with nonlinear elements and those which make use of
continuous and discrete time.

As an extension of MATLAB, SIMULINK adds many features specific to
dynamic systems while retaining all of MATLAB's general purpose
functionality.

Using SIMULINK, you model a system graphically, sidestepping much of
the nuisance associated with conventional programming.

Following are two sets of comments on IDL:
1. By Pierre Maxted
2. By Amara Graps

================

1. Comments by Pierre Maxted

I find that IDL is good for "playing" with data. This works well for
astronomers who seem to end up always wanting to do something a little
different to last time to data that always has slightly different quirks
every time. I also find that it is a rather easy language in which to
write my own routines. This is probably because I can start with
interactive IDL to get the feel for what the data is like and what I want
to do with it - this then becomes a simple batch file which can be turned
into a routine if the procedure is useful - this seems to be a natural
way to develop things. These libraries of routines are what makes IDL
really powerful in my opinion. I found that adding the astronomy user's
library to IDL was like adding wheels to a car. I would recommend to
anyone considering using IDL to find out what libraries are out
there (e.g. starting at the IDL WWW home page).

Whatever you add to the FAQ, make one point clear - calling IDL a fancy
plotting package is like calling a Formula 1 racing car good for picking
up the kids from school - IDL can do plotting, but that is not its
strength.

Well, I agree that the hard copy manuals are rather opaque but Version 4
of IDL has online help (Hyperhelp) that is rather good - especially since
it had text searching capabilities so that you can go straight to the bit
you need (usually).

2. Comments by Amara Graps

Following is an excerpt of comments by [Amara Graps]:

If you install IDL without a valid license, you will get IDL's
7 minute demo mode. This mode is designed for users who are
considering buying the package.

IDL is a vector-based language that makes it easy to manipulate arrays
and matrices.  I've done testing comparing IDL speed to
Fortran in various actions, and IDL was as fast as a Fortran program for
the IDL array computations where loops were removed (i.e., when
using implicit loops in IDL instead of explicit FOR statements).

The scientific functions and procedures that come with IDL are often all
that scientists need.  In addition, there are net archives
containing contributed routines.  The archives at
John Hopkins and at Goddard are especially good (see below).

The language, for the most part is "open", i.e. you can see the
text of any particular procedure or function, in case you doubt the
technique, or want to modify it. Some functions and procedures are
black-box, intrinsic functions or procedures, but not nearly as many as
Matlab (see below) are.

Most work in IDL is done at the command line level.  However, IDL supplies
rudimentary "widgets" to wrap a GUI around your procedures and
functions. You can create buttons, menus, scrollboxes etc.

Three-d plotting is currently not very well documented, and the way that
IDL does it is very convoluted. Other users and I have complained about
it, and I think RSI are taking steps to better document how to do it.

Image processing and animation is pretty slick.
If you need to do "slicing and dicing" of a volume, in a way like
Spyglass Dicer, IDL has a really great widget routine to do it.
The IDL plots are high quality enough to use in initial journal
submissions.

RSI's support (writing to support@rsinc.com) is pretty good, I
usually get responses within 24-34 hours. You have to pay yearly technical
support costs, though- about $200 year (don't remember exactly how much).
The Usenet group: comp.lang.idl-pvwave has some smart programmers giving
answers if you don't want to pay for the IDL technical support. RSI
usually doesn't answer questions on that newsgroup (they have a company
policy against promoting IDL there because it's shared by two products:
IDL and PV-WAVE).

I've never liked the IDL documentation very much. The information that you
need probably *is* in the manuals, but it's somewhat hard to find (the
manuals are organized in a weird way).  [Note, however, the comments
by Pierre Maxted above].

q125.7. Comparison of IDL and Matlab

Following is an excerpt of a paper by [Amara Graps]:
For the full text of her review, please see:
http://www.amara.com/papers/miscpap.html   Amara Graps' Paper
ftp://ftp.amara.com/papers/IDL_Matlab.txt  Amara Graps' Paper via ftp

IDL is a package that began life as an image-processing utility that has
grown to be a general-purpose numerical analysis tool. Matlab started as
a numerical analysis package that now includes [at extra cost] image
processing tools. Now the two have a similar scientific data-analysis
environment, with capabililties to build GUI programs and do very robust
data analysis.

(Note: all prices are approximate October 1995 prices - SJS)
They each cost about the same: ~$1500 for Mac and PC versions and more for
Unix (~4000 -- single user to $15,000 -- unlimited number of users).

Matlab is popular among education institutions because it has exceptional
educational discounts. If you are an academic, Matlab can be had for
$495 and each toolbox only $195. My NASA colleagues thought that
MathWorks "nickled- and-dimed" them with the costs of the Toolkits (like
the signal processing toolkit), but given what you get, it probably
isn't that unreasonable.

IDL seems to be more widespread in the NASA communities probably because
the original developer used several spacecraft teams (Pioneer Venus and
Voyager) as test beds for the IDL software.

IDL is more of a true programming language. Matlab has scripts and
functions and no way to explicitly type a variable. IDL has programs,
procedures, and functions and a language syntax sort of like a cross
between Fortran, Pascal, and APL. If you have programmed in Fortran
before, then the syntax will be a snap to learn. Matlab's syntax is much
more compact than IDL's. For example: x = transpose(y) in IDL is x=y' in
Matlab.

Matlab has many more built-in, intrinsic functions than IDL.
MatLab has many optional Toolkits, such as a Signal Processing
Toolkit and an Image Processing Toolkit, which are libraries
of more intrinsic functions.

Reading and writing files, and handling formats such as GIF,
PICT, GDF, and custom formats, seems much easier in IDL than MATLAB.
Handling directories is difficult in MATLAB when run on non-unix
machines.

Matlab has more types of graph types than IDL, and handling
colors is simpler than IDL. However, I found most
other Matlab graphical programming non-intuitive. It uses a system where
each element in a graph is an "object." These objects can have
sub-objects. So to change an element in a graph, say the axis color, you
have to first find the object (a "get" function), and then set it to the
color you want. IDL has system variables storing all graphics elements
which can be easily changed. One can also customize a graph upon making
the graph, with a keyword.

IDL's technical support is pretty good, but Matlab's is better. Post
a question on comp.soft-sys.matlab and either a developer, the company
president, or a tech support person will respond that day. You can call
them, too, but it's not a toll-free call.

O-Matrix For Windows:
[author]:
O-Matrix is a complete solution for analysis, visualization, and
rapid application development, (RAD).  The interactive environment
enables both point-and-shoot oriented analysis for rapid solutions
and a powerful language and debugger for large demanding applications.
The integrated matrix language provides performance that far exceeds
typical integrated environments and often rivals compiled code for
numerically-intensive applications.

SPT - The Signal Processing Toolbox for O-Matrix:
SPT for O-Matrix  provides a broad, extensible
set of functions and utilities that expands the capabilities of
O-Matrix in the area of digital signal processing.  Built on the
high-performance capabilities and flexibility of O-Matrix, the toolbox
contains tools for algorithm development, data analysis, and visual
presentation.  SPT enables the rapid development of robust, high-performance
applications in areas including digital filtering, spectral estimation,
digital communication system simulation, time series analysis, real time
control, geophysics, and more.  The package comes with complete source code,
online tutorials and examples, and unlimited free technical support.

KBF - The Kalman Filter Interface Pack for O-Matrix:
The KBF interface simplifies the design of a filter
or smoother by dividing the design process into simple steps with each
step corresponding to an input window or dialog.  Extensive plotting of
results, including residuals and correlations is also automated.  In
addition, a simulation feature is included to aid in testing the validity
of the design. KBF is used in a wide range of applications such as tracking,
weather and earth process modeling, economic forecasting and bioengineering.

Acton, Forman S.  1990
   Numerical methods that [usually] work
   Harper & Row, Publishers
   ISBN 0883854503.
[Daniel Pick] This book is almost worth its price just for the cathartic
interlude in the middle of the book on what not to compute.  You should
require your students to read it, learn it, live it.  You may find just
giving them the railroad problem found at the beginning of the book a
worthwhile exercise. [Bill Frensley] Amen, brother! The only complaint
that I have about Acton's interlude is that after demolishing the notion
of "fitting exponential data," he fails to point out that this is the
inverse Laplace transform problem.  Perhaps if everyone read this and
made the connection, we would be spared the monthly "is there any good
algorithm for the inverse Laplace transform?"

The 1996 conference on the State of the Art in Numerical Analysis was organized
to provide the numerical analysis community, and users of numerical methods,
with a forum where an account of the important recent developments in the
subject could be presented in a coherent and concentrated way in a manner
accessible to the non-specialist in the sub-area.

   ISBN 0883851261.

[Daniel Pick] This contains several outstanding essays from several

   A Numerical Library in C for Scientists and Engineers
   CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL
   ISBN 0-8493-7376-X
   Telephone: 407-994-0555

This book is basically a compilation of program listings,
with a diskette containing source code.  The listings
are accompanied by brief overviews of the algorithms
involved, and generally include references.  There is
no discussion of theory.  While the text by Stoer & Bulirsch is at
the theoretical end of the NA spectrum, this text is at the
application end.  Although the program calling parameters
are well described, as far as I could see the programs
contain no internal documentation whatsoever.
Although this book is copyright 1995,
the references contain one source dated 1992 (Press et al's volume),
one source dated 1981 (NUMAL in Fortran), and one source dated
1980 (NUMAL in Algol).  The remainder of the references
are dated 1976 and earlier.  It's not clear to me that this book
offers anything over Press et al's text.  Lau has far less discussion of
theory and methodology, and while Press's internal documentation
of programs is poor, Lau's book has none whatsoever.  [SJS]

[Donald Knuth]  Science is what we understand well enough
to explain to a computer.  Art is everything else we do.
During the past several years an important part of
mathematics has been transformed from an Art to a
Science: No longer do we need to get a brilliant insight in order to
evaluate sums of binomial coefficients, and many similar formulas that
arise frequently in practice; we can now follow a mechanical procedure
and discover the answers quite systematically.

I'm especially pleased to see the appearance of this book, because its
authors have not only played key roles in the new developments, they
are also master expositors of mathematics. It is always a treat to
read their publications, especially when they are discussing really
important stuff.

Science advances whenever an Art becomes a Science. And the state of
the Art advances too, because people always leap into new territory
once they have understood more about the old. This book will help you
reach new frontiers.

[author]:    The book has three closely connected parts.
The first is Linear Algebra,
which is the fundamental tool in positioning calculations.  The second is
Geodesy, which includes the correct weightings for observation errors and
the development of least squares.  The third is GPS, which we describe in
detail at several levels : first the basic structure of the GPS system, then
the algorithms that yield accurate positions from inaccurate pseudoranges, 
and finally the Kalman filtering (and "Bayes" filtering) that give superior
accuracy in postprocessing a long series of observations.

q205. Dense Linear Algebra Systems

The best resources for linear algebra are:

The texts by Golub & Van Loan and by Watkins.

On the net, library package LAPACK, with BLAS, from netlib
(see q115.1, "Netlib") is a widely recommended replacement
for EISPACK and LINPACK.  It handles dense matrices only.

As far as complete packages, nearly all NA packages, both on
the net and commercial, include linear algebra as part of their
core.  See the listings above.

Aztec: A Parallel Iterative Package for Linear Systems

http://www.cs.sandia.gov/CRF/aztec1.html AZTEC
[authors]: 
Aztec is an iterative library that greatly simplifies the parallelization
process when solving the linear systems of equations Ax = b where A is a user
supplied nxn sparse matrix, b is a user supplied vector of length n and x is a
vector of length n to be computed. Aztec is intended as a software tool for
users who want to avoid cumbersome parallel programming details but who have
large sparse linear systems which require an efficiently utilized parallel
processing system.  A collection of data transformation tools are provided that
allow for easy creation of distributed sparse unstructured matrices for
parallel solution. Once the distributed matrix is created, computation can be
performed on any of the parallel machines running Aztec: workstation clusters
(DEC, SGI, SUN, LINUX, etc.), Cray T3E, Intel TeraFlop, Intel Paragon, IBM SP2,
nCUBE 2 as well as other MPI platforms, vector machines or serial machines.

Aztec includes a number of Krylov iterative methods such as conjugate gradient
(CG), generalized minimum residual (GMRES) and stabilized biconjugate gradient
(BiCGSTAB) to solve systems of equations.  These Krylov methods are used in
conjunction with various preconditioners such as polynomial or domain
decomposition methods using LU or incomplete LU factorizations within
subdomains. Although the matrix A can be general, the package has been designed
for matrices arising from the approximation of partial differential equations
(PDEs).

q210.3. Types of Random Number Generators

Random number generators typically consist of three components:
	* The basic generator, described further below.
	* Some generators contain a shuffle box.  First described
	in Marsaglia 1965.  Also described in Knuth 1981 and Press et al 1992.
	* A transformation to the desired probability distribution.
	See Press et al 1992 or, better yet, Law 1991 or Devroye 1986.

There are four common types of basic generators.
	* q210.6.1, "linear congruential (LCG)"
	* q210.6.2, "add-with-carry and subtract-with-borrow (AWCG, SWBG)"
	* q210.6.3, "multiply-with-carry (MWCG)"
	* q210.6.4, "inversive conguential (ICG)"

===================================

q210.6.1. Linear Congruential Generators (LCG)

Linear congruential generators are of the form
x(n) = a * x(n-1) + b  mod M
A good discussion of this type is in the text by Press et al.
These are by far the most common form in use, and have periods
in the range 10^6 to 10^9 when using 32 bit words.  Unfortunately,
they have some unpleasant properties.  When taken in pairs,
triplets, or n-tuples, the random values often fall on only
a few planes in n-space.  Using a shuffle box can
break up this uniformity.  For more information on the
problems associated with linear congruential generators,
see Marsaglia 1968, Marsaglia 1993 and Sullivan 1993.
See also Marsaglia's web site, described under
q210.7, "Tests for Randomness".


===================================

q210.6.2. Add-with-carry and Subtract-with-borrow Generators (AWCG, SWBG)

Add-with-carry generators have the form:

x(n) = x(n-s) + x(n-r) + carry  mod M

Subtract-with-borrow generators have the form:

x(n) = x(n-s) - x(n-r) - carry  mod M

See Marsaglia 1991.
These generators have much longer periods, from 10^200 to 10^500,
than LCGs, and they are almost as fast as LCGs.
Unfortunately they too have the problem of falling
mainly on the planes.  See Tezuka 1993.
Again, a shuffle box, as described in Press et al, can eliminate
this problem.
The implementation by Marsaglia and Zaman may be found at:
ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/systems/ibmpc/msdos/math/fsultra1.zip  Marsaglia


===================================

q210.6.3. Multiply-with-carry Generators (MWCG)

Multiply-with-carry generators have the form:

x(n) = a*x(n-1) + carry  mod M

[George Marsaglia]:
Here is a simple version, one so simple and good I predict
it will be the system generator for many future computers:

x(n)=a*x(n-1)+carry mod 2^32

With multiplier 'a' chosen from a large set of easily found
integers, the period is a*2^31-1, around 2^60, and
I have yet to find a test it will not pass!

[Charles Knechtel]:
George Marsaglia has some interesting new ideas for pseudorandom number 
generation using MWCG and MWCG combined with other pseudorandom number 
generators (RNGs); these new ideas are implemented as part of the Diehard 
suite of RNG tests.  The best of these seem to pass 
all the Diehard tests, even tests that many common pseudorandom number 
generators fail.
Source is at the Diehard page, described at:
q210.7, "Tests for Randomness".

===================================

q210.6.4. Inversive Conguential Generators (ICG)

Inversive congruential generators are of the form

   x(n) = a * ~(x(n-1)) + b    mod M
   where:
   M is prime
   "~y" denotes the multiplicative inverse of y in
   the field over {0, 1, ..., M-1} using arithmetic modulo M,
   and ~0 is 0.

ICGs do not have the "mainly in the planes" problem.
See the pLab, described above at
q210.1, "Web Sites for Random Number Generators",
for more info on ICGs.

[Charles Knechtel]:
Marsaglia's Diehard suite of RNG tests, at
q210.7, "Tests for Randomness"
also contains a subroutine named 
makeinvc which implements an ICG and generates a file of pseudorandom 
numbers named INVCONG.32; however, examination of the FORTRAN source code 
for makeinvc shows that a modulus M equal to 2^32 was used (see file 
makewhat.f.  Eichenauer-Herrmann (1992, p. 173, 175) notes that 
certain ICGs with power of two modulus have distributional disadvantages 
compared to the "excellent quality" of ICGs with prime modulus.  Indeed, 
the documentation for INVCONG.32 remarks that makeinvc fails to pass many 
of the Diehard tests (see the last section of file makef.txt from
the Diehard archive fortran.tar.gz.  An ICG with prime 
modulus should have better uniform properties than makeinvc, and Otmar 
Lendl's ICG implementation might be speedier than makeinvc.

Linear triangle-based interpolation
is quick and dirty - probably the best compromise available if you are
in a hurry.  Natural neighbor interpolation is much slower but does
provide a result that most people consider to be closest to that which an
experienced manual draftsman would generate.
The 'kriging' method is a
variation on the splines technique - the main difference being that a
subjectively selected probabilistic function is used rather than one of
the analytically derived radial basis functions.  This class of method
generates discontinuities at points where the interpolation subset
changes, and kriging attempts to ameliorate this effect be recomputing
the coefficients for each interpolation point - this makes it very slow.

OAX:
http://www.tuns.ca/~hey/ocean/oview.html   OAX
What is OAX ? 
[author]:
OAX is an spacial objective analysis program. OAX applies the method
of optimal interpolation (objective analysis) to estimate the values of
variables at specified points in a multidimensional space. For each point,
the computation is based on a weighted average of the values of a
specified number of data points (i.e. "nearest neighbours") which are
closest to that point. For the sake of efficiency, several dependent
variables can be interpolated simultaneously using the same weights if
the underlying statistical model and relative noise level in the input data
are assumed to be same for each dependent variable. 

In this version, OAX extends the capability of earlier implementations
(OPTIMAL_ESTIMATOR directive, oax3.0, oax4.0) by allowing the
parameters controlling the calculation of the weights to vary as a
function of the independent variables, and by allowing the specification
of a relative uncertainty (NOISE) for each input data record separately.

Software

ODRPACK, from netlib
[author]:
ODRPACK is a portable collection of Fortran subprograms
for fitting a model to data.  It is designed primarily for
instances when the explanatory as well as the response variables
have significant errors, implementing a highly efficient
algorithm for solving the weighted orthogonal distance regression
problem, i.e., for minimizing the sum of the squares of the weighted
orthogonal distances between each data point and the curve described
by the model equation.

===================================

q230.2.1. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm

[Alan Miller]:

The non-linear least-squares problem is to find a vector of parameter
values, a, to minimize the sum of squares of differences between a
given vector, y, of observed values and a vector of fitted values
f(a,x) where the values of x are known.   e.g. a particularly notorious
problem is to fit:

    y = a(0) + a(1).exp(-a(2).x) + a(3).exp(-a(4).x)

sometimes with more exponential terms, to a set of (x,y)-pairs.

Writing S = sum [y(i) - f(a,x(i))]^2, where i denotes the i-th observation
pair, we have that the first and second derivatives of S with respect to
the parameters, a(j), are:

   S'  = -2.sum [r(i).(df/da(j))]
   S'' =  2.sum [(df/da(j)).(df/da(k))] - 2.sum [r(i).d2f/(da(j)da(k))]

where r(i) is the i-th residual = y(i) - f(a,x(i)).

The Gauss-Newton (G-N) method uses the linearization of f about the latest
estimates of a, and solves a linear least sqaures problem to obtain a
new vector a.

If J denotes the Jacobian = the n x k matrix of values of (df/da(j)) at
the current estimates of the parameter values, where n is the number of
observations and k is the number of parameters, then the G-N method ignores
the second derivatives of f in S'' and uses

   a(new) = a(old) + inv(J'J).J'r

This guarantees a downhill search direction but often overshoots unless
good starting values are available.

The Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) method uses a trust-region approach, also
known as ridge regression or regularization, to shrink the step sizes to
ensure a reduction in S at each iteration.   In the L-M method

   a(new) = a(old) + inv(J'J + D).J'r

where D is a diagonal matrix.   Levenberg suggested that D = d.I, that is
that the same scalar value be added to each diagonal element.   In practice,
the diagonal elements of J'J are often of vastly different magnitudes,
and Marquardt suggested D = lambda.diag(J'J).   For the first iteration,
lambda is given a fairly large value (say 1.0).   If the first attempt
at an iteration reduces S then lambda is reduced for the next iteration
by a factor of say 5-10.   If the first step increases S then lambda is
increased by a factor of perhaps 3-5 until S is reduced.   The final
value of lambda for the iteration is then used for the next iteration.

The L-M method converges upon a stationary point (or sometimes a sub-space)
which may be the minimum which is being sought, but it could be a
saddle-point, a local minimum, or one or more of the parameter values may
tend to infinity.

The Jacobian of first derivatives is often ill-conditioned so that QR
factorizations are usually employed to solve the LS equations.

The L-M algorithm is often very efficient.   Methods which use second
derivatives require substantially more computation and then it is
common to find that the Hessian matrix is not positive definite very
close to the minimum.

Software:

MINPACK includes L-M algorithms using either analytic derivatives or
derivatives estimated from differences.   Obtain from the minpack
directory of netlib.

For many problems, the function f is linear in some of the parameters.
In the sum of exponentials example mentioned, f is linear in a(0), a(1)
and a(3).   The VARPRO code uses an L-M type of algorithm but separates
the linear from the non-linear parameters.   This code is available from
the opt directory of netlib.

The package NL2SOL (TOMS algorithm 573) uses a hybrid combination of G-N
and estimation of a positive-definite approximation to the Hessian from
differences of first derivatives.   It is available from the toms
directory of netlib (Fortran 90 version from www.ozemail.com.au/~milleraj).
Updates which allow for bounds on parameter values can be found in netlib
directory port with file names starting n2f, n2g, rn2f or rn2g.

There is a very easy-to-use shareware package for PCs including graphics
(NLREG) which is based upon the NL2SOL package, and includes graphics.
It is more successful than many of the non-linear least-squares solvers found
in commercial statistical packages.   It can be downloaded from the math
directory of simtelnet.

q230.8. Fitting a circle to a set of points


See "Least-squares fitting by circles, Computing 57,
179-185 (1996)", by Helmuth Spaeth.  Further
corresponding papers concerning fitting with conic sections could be
obtained at
http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/math/personen/spaeth/spaeth.html  Helmuth Spaeth.



Problem: Given N Points: (x1,y1); (x2,y2).. (xN,yN), we want to find for
best-fit circle: (X0,Y0), R. (Note: for fitting an *ellipse*, substitute
the equation for an ellipse for the equation for a circle in the "Brute
Force Approach").


Brute Force Approach (leads to a non-linear system): [Amara Graps]


Idea: Minimize by least squares the root-mean-squared error of the radius
in the equation for a circle. In this method, one minimizes the sum of
the squares of the *length* differences, which gives you a non-linear
problem with all the associated pitfalls.

   (x-X0)^2 + (y-Y0)^2 = R^2   Equation for a circle
   R = SQRT[ (x-X0)^2 + (y-Y0)^2)  ]     Radius of the circle

where:
   (X0,Y0) = center of circle
   (x,y) = point coordinates
   R = radius

1) Get first estimate for (X0,Y0,R).

(Details: Find some points to make first estimates- either solve the
circle exactly (3 equations, 3 unknowns) to get a first estimate of the
center and radius, or just do a kind of centroid calculation on all
points- to get a rough estimate of the center and radius.)

2) Calculate r (r1, r2,.. rN) for each of your N points from the equation
for a radius of a circle.

3) Calculate the root-mean-squared error
For example, for 5 given points on the circle:

RMS error = SQRT[ [ (r1-R)^2 + (r2-R)^2 + (r3-R)^2 + (r4-R)^2
                  + (r5-R)^2] / 3 ]

(dividing by "3" because we have 3 free parameters.)

4) Change (X0,Y0,R) slightly in your minimization algorithm
to try a new (X0,Y0,R).

(Details: Because minimization algorithms can get very computationally
intensive, if one's problem is a simple one, I would look for a "canned"
minimization routine. Some commercial computer programs for plotting and
spreadsheets do this sort of thing. For example, the Excel spreadsheet
has a built-in "solver" that will perform minimzation. Other
possibilties for software: Matlab with the optimization toolbox,
MACSYMA, ODRPACK from Netlib, and the recent L-BFGS-B package
which allows you to specify bounds on the variables, from:
ftp://eecs.nwu.edu/pub/lbfgs  L-BFGS-B

5) Calculate r (r1, r2 etc.) again from new (X0,Y0,R) above.

6) Calculate RMS error again.

7) Compare current RMS error with previous RMS error. If it
doesn't vary by more some small amount, say 10^{-3} then
you're done, otherwise continue steps 4 -- 7.

Instrum & Meast., IM-35, no.1, pp. 31-35, 1986. [Peter Somlo]


Other (more elegant) approaches that reduce to a linear system.

If you choose to minimize the squares of the *area* differences, you get
a linear problem, which is a much safer way. [Pawel Gora, Zdislav V.
Kovarik, Daniel Pfenniger, Condensed by Amara Graps]

1. Function to minimize is (sum of the area differences):
   Q = Sum { [ (xi - X0)^2 + (yi -Y0)^2 - R^2 ]^2 , i=1..N }

2. A necessary condition is the system of 3 equations with 3 unknowns
   X0, Y0, R. Calculate the partial derivatives of Q, with respect to
   X0, Y0, R. (all d's are partial)

   dQ / dX0 = 0
   dQ / dY0 = 0
   dQ / dR = 0

3. Developing we get the linear least-squares problem:

   | x1 y1 1 | | a |    | -x1^2-y1^2 |
   | x2 y2 1 | | b | =~ | -x2^2-y2^2 |
   | x3 y3 1 | | c |    | -x3^2-y3^2 |
   | x4 y4 1 |          | -x4^2-y4^2 |
   | x5 y5 1 |          | -x5^2-y5^2 |
     .....               .........
   (for example, for 5 points)

where  a = -2 X0; b = -2 Y0 ; c = X0^2 + Y0^2 - R^2.
Take any good least-squares algorithm to solve it, yielding a,b,c.
So the final circle solution will be given with
X0 = -a/2; Y0 = -b/2; R^2 = X0^2+Y0^2 - c.

By the way, with 5 points you can also find the unique quadratic form
(ellipse, hyperbola) which passes exactly through 5 points.
With more than 5 points one can do a linear least-squares as well.
The problem is then to minimize:

   | x1^2-y1^2 x1y1 x1 y1 1 | | a |    | -x1^2-y1^2 |
   | x2^2-y2^2 x2y2 x2 y2 1 | | b | =~ | -x2^2-y2^2 |
   | x3^2-y3^2 x3y3 x3 y3 1 | | c |    | -x3^2-y3^2 |
   | x4^2-y4^2 x4y4 x4 y4 1 | | e |    | -x4^2-y4^2 |
   | x5^2-y5^2 x5y5 x5 y5 1 | | f |    | -x5^2-y5^2 |
     .....                                .........

how to implement these least-squares problems at:
ftp://obsftp.unige.ch/fit  Circle Programs


The robust or L1 or least-first-power approximation [Zdislav V. Kovarik].


If you try to minimize

   W(a,b,r) = SUM(j=1:N) ABS (((x_j-a)^2 + (y_j-b)^2)^(1/2) - r)

all you have to do is set up the 10 (i.e. if 5, choose 3) circles passing
through every choice of 3 of 5 points, calculate W(a,b,r) for each of
them and pick the minimizing circle. The extra feature is that this
procedure separates and discards points which are conspicuously far from
the majority trend. (Of course, it becomes increasingly time-consuming
when the number of given points increases.)

SLDRIVER: Interactive Sturm-Liouville Package
ftp://ftp.rmcs.cranfield.ac.uk/pub/departments/seas/cised/numanal/  SLDRIVER

The classical Sturm-Liouville problem (SLP) is
        (-p(x) y')' + q(x) y = lambda w(x) y                           (1)
where y is a real function of x on a real interval a<x<b with appropriate
boundary conditions at a and b, and p, q and w are given functions.  The
main numerical task is to compute eigenvalues and associated
eigenfunctions.  Algorithms for (1) have been a model for attacking more
general problems such as matrix-vector SLPs and linear Hamiltonian
eigenproblems.

"Regular" SLPs generally pose few difficulties, but "singular" SLPs show
great variety of behaviour: the spectrum can comprise both eigenvalues and
continuous spectrum; the eigenvalues can form a finite set, or an infinite
sequence that may be increasing, decreasing or two-sided, bounded or
unbounded.  Eigenvalues can lie within continuous spectrum.  Good library
software has been available for some years and has gradually enlarged the
range of SLPs that can be reliably handled.

SLDRIVER is an interactive Fortran 90 program which supports exploration of
a set of Sturm-Liouville problems with the four SL-solvers (whose source
comes with the package):
    SLEIGN, SLEDGE, SL02F and SLEIGN2.

The scaled boundary finite-element method
http://lchpc14.epfl.ch  Scaled boundary finite-element method
[author]:
The scaled boundary finite-element method,
not only combines the advantages of the finite-element and
boundary-element
methods but also presents appealing features of its own:
  *  reduction of spatial dimension by one as only the boundary is
     discretized with finite elements
  *  no fundamental solution required
  *  general anisotropic material analyzed without any increase in
     computational effort
  *  semi-analytical representation of displacements and stresses
     yielding accurate stress intensity factors
  *  boundary condition on free surfaces and on interfaces between
     different materials enforced exactly without any discretization
  *  no singular integrals to be evaluated
  *  symmetric static-stiffness and mass matrices of bounded medium
     with respect to the degrees of freedom on boundary generated

[author]: The book is directed to graduate students in mathematics and to
young researchers. We take into account that most of the research is now
concentrated on finite elements for hard problems and on the fast
solution of the resulting equations. Therefore the nonconforming
elements and saddle point problems get as much space as the conforming
elements. Moreover we treat the method of conjugate gradients and
multigrid methods. Finally we present an introduction to the
application of finite elements in solid mechanics which up to now
does not exist in textbooks in a similar way.

q260.4. Comparison of Meshing Software Packages

[Albert M. Hines, Feb 1996]:
This table reflects the best information that I can gather
to date on some of the more popular meshers.  Many others exist
and may be better or worse than those listed here. This study was
conducted by Howmet, a manufacturing corporation with no incentive
to support or reject any package over another. Portions of the
study were also funded by your generous tax donations through an
ICCA program designed to enhance the capability of US investment
casting through (among many other things) automeshing software.

The meshes were used for heat transfer and fluid flow predominantly.
A limited amount of stress analysis and electromagnetics were also
investigated.  The desired modeling analysis is a crucial factor
in determining whether a meshing package will support the
mesh quality and refinement necessary for a simulation.
(e.g. mesh quality is almost a non-issue for heat transfer,
but not for stress!)   The geometries that I have considered
are aerospace turbine engine components: complex 3-D thin walled
structures. Bulky or spindly geometries may behave differently
(e.g. engine blocks, oil rigs, etc.).

The scale used is 0 to 10. A zero means that it meets none of my
expectations. A 10 means that it meets all of my expectations.
A cumulative score should not be obtained by adding columns.
Many entries are more important than others. Weighting for
the various tasks are different for each analyst/application.
The scores are often subjective and should be considered at best
approximate. They do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Howmet
Corporation or, for that matter, of anyone other than myself.
They are, however, the result of careful and expensive investigation
into the market.

Any questions or comments should directed to me at "ahines@howmet.com".

NOTES
-----
*    OCTREE surface mesh obtained by extracting faces of its solid elements.

(a)  Should mesh the first time with given parameters. This refers to
tetrahedra only.

(b)  Includes things like a finely meshed boundary with coarsely meshed
interior, ignoring features smaller than a given size, multiple element
layers through thin sections, multiple meshing algorithms, etc. Refers
to tetrahedral elements.

(c)  Being in industry, practicality is a must. Meshes > ~100,000 nodes
do not run in a reasonable amount of time in our lab.  If a
program cannot mesh a part within this limitation, I consider
it unable to mesh the part, even if it might successfully
generate the mesh. Automeshers should allow the specification
of a target number of nodes. Any mesh above this size should
send a flag to remesh, ignoring small features.

(d)  Again, from a practical point of view, there are limits beyond which I
consider the program to fail. The most glaring comparison is
between PATRAN and MeshCAST. A typical part that meshes less
than 10 minutes with MeshCAST normally takes several days to
mesh in PATRAN. It is likely that given infinite time, PATRAN
would succeed (after all, it contains the RPI finite octree
mesher as one of its algorithms!), however, I can't justify
tying a machine up for a week to find out if it will mesh (and often it
crashes at the end of the meshing cycle!).

(e)  There are many if's and's & but's here. Basically I use aspect ratio and
dihedral angle for tetrahedra, jacobian at the gauss points for hex'es,
wedge's, and quad's, and interior angle for triangles. These are the only
element types that I use.

(f)  For many problems, I could not successfully mesh the part, so I sent the
geometry to the software vendor. In other cases, I sent it specifically
to evaluate the software run under the developer's care. Score reflects
willingness, speed, size, and quality of the mesh received.

(g)  I am partial to a Mac-like interface, which I consider to be the computer
world's 'reference standard'. Program should require minimal training and
manuals. All options should be available on the menus (no hidden or
cryptic commands). This is not just personal preference, but time and
dollars in training.

(1)  Cost is annual lease, US dollars, except as noted. Platform is HP-735
network license.  Cost is what we pay, not necessarily list price.

(2)  Unigraphics common database module $3,000 extra (i.e. $9,800). Base
license includes one translator, we chose IGES.

(3)  This price includes the fluids, thermal, radiation, solver modules. I am
not sure of the price of just MeshCAST by itself.

(4)  This is very approximated assuming infinite meshing time.

(5)  Versions tested: OCTREE: March 1,1995, P3: v1.4, Meshcast: v3.0.3,
Hypermesh: v2.00b, Algor: July, 1995.

The KASKADE 3.1 software package solves 
linear scalar elliptic and parabolic problems in 1, 2, 3 space dimensions
with adaptive finite element methods.

Furthermore, the toolbox includes extensions for handling systems of 
equations and example algorithms for nonlinear methods
used in obstacle, porous media or Stefan problems.

Core of the program is a variety og multilevel/multigrid preconditioners
for the arising linear systems.

This object-oriented code is written in C++ and can
be compiled with Gnu g++, version 2.7.2, and some other compilers.
If you want to compile with  Gnu g++, version 2.6.3, you have to change
the definition of the complex-type in the file general.h.

The program solves the same mathematical problem classes as its predecessor
KASKADE 2.x, which is written in C.

We provided a graphical user interface ZGUI to the numerical program 
based on the interface language Tcl/Tk of j. Ousterhout.

q260.5.6. Tri

ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/scott/tri  Tri

[author]:
Tripoint was first developed by David Eppstein to triangulate point set
input in two dimensions, following the algorithm in "Provably Good Mesh
Generation" by Bern, Eppstein, and Gilbert[1].   During the summer of 1991,
Scott Mitchell extended the program to triangulate polygonal regions with
holes, again in two dimensions.  The algorithm followed borrows ideas both
from [1] and "Quality Mesh Generation in Three Dimensions" by Mitchell
and Vavasis[2].

Tripoint takes input from text files as the polygon to triangulate.  Output
is also as text files, using the same data format.  Points are represented
by their coordinates, and edges by the indecies of their endpoints.
There is a matlab code front end, called drawmesh.m.  This allows the
graphical input of the input polygon using the mouse, and the display with
zooming of the output triangulation.  There is also matlab code called
dispmesh.m, which allows the displaying of output only.  This allows the
user freedom over how to generate the input.

The algorithm is similar to one in "Provably
Good Mesh Generation"[1].  The main differences include: Tripoint uses
connected component information while generating the quadtree, as in  [2].
Tripoint does not cut dangling acute triangles from the input as a first step
as in [1].  Ideally, as in [2], tripoint would center input verticies in
boxes, and use a very general and easy algorithm for triangulating
individual boxes.  Instead, vertices are not centered, and
the ideal algorithm is used with added special case analysis for boxes near
an input vertex.

Scott Mitchell continues to support tripoint.
We would eventually like to implement a three dimentional algorithm
following [2].

[author]: Version 5 of Craig Douglas' multigrid package. This is an
abstract solver. It is PDE, domain, and discretization independent.
It only handles linear problems, however. It is an ongoing project
with a number of contributors from around the world. Some of these
wish to remain anonymous. Serial, parallel, and semi-chaotic solvers
are or will be included during 1994. A paper describing this is in
the file mgnet/papers/Douglas/mad5.ps.  This is an object oriented code.
The user interface is written in C. Most of the solvers are
written in Fortran-77+m4. The same calling sequence is used
independent of the data's type (real and complex, single and double
precision are supported). The user interface builds all of the truly

http://www.asci.fr/~prudhomm/gfem-html/gfemenglish.html FreeFEM, in English
http://www.asci.fr/~prudhomm/gfem-html/  FreeFEM, in French

FreeFEM is a graphical software which is built around a programming
language dedicated to the partial differential equations.         

FreeFEM solves,with the finite element method,scalar linear elliptic
PDEs of order 2,the time dependant equations and more generally all
iterative sheme with PDE combination for example the heat  
equation,convection-diffusion and even the Navier-Stokes equations.The
program is written in C,it is shareware and portable.

Domains are defined by analytic equations of the boundary,and
triangulated by a Delaunay-Voronoi algorithm.
The language allows the manipulation of the complex numbers with the
reserved words I,Re,Im.         
Systems of equations are also supported.  Thus one can solve,for example
the problems of the linear elasticity.

q260.5.16. MUDPACK
http://www.scd.ucar.edu/css/software/mudpack  MUDPACK
[author]:
MUDPACK includes a suite of portable fortran programs which automatically
discretize and use multigrid techniques to generate second- and fourth-order
approximations to elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on
rectangular regions.  The elliptic PDEs can be real or complex in two-
and three-dimensions with any combination of mixed derivate, specified, or
periodic boundary conditions.  Multigrid V or W cycles which use point,
line(s), or planar relaxation and fully weighted residual restriction are
available for algorithm tuning to obtain optimal multigrid performance.
MUDPACK was written to avoid repeated "re-invention of the wheel" in human
code development time which can be at least as important as saving machine
cycles.

q260.5.17. METIS

http://www.cs.umn.edu/~metis  METIS
http://www.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis  METIS

[author]:
METIS is a Software Package for Partitioning Unstructured Graphs, Partitioning
Meshes, and Computing Fill-Reducing Orderings of Sparse Matrices.

Graph partitioning has extensive applications in many areas, including
scientific computing, VLSI design, and task scheduling. The problem is
to partition the vertices of a graph in k roughly equal parts, such that
the number of edges connecting vertices in different parts is minimized.

Graph partitioning is of particular importance in finite element
computations on parallel computers, since a good partition significantly
reduces the amount of communication, increasing the performance.

Graph partitioning algorithms are also used to compute orderings for
sparse matrices, in order to minimize the amount of fill and to increase
the concurrency that can be exploited during parallel direct
factorization.

METIS is a set of programs that implement various graph partitioning
algorithms
that are based on the multilevel paradigm. The advantages of METIS
compared to
other similar packages are the following:

- Provides high quality partitions!
Experiments on a large number of graphs arising in various domains
including
finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation
show that
METIS produces partitions that are consistently better than those
produced
by other widely used algorithms. The partitions produced by METIS
are
consistently 10% to 50% better than those produced by spectral
partitioning
algorithms.

- It is extremely fast!
Experiments on a wide range of graphs has shown that METIS is one to
two
orders of magnitude faster than other widely used partitioning
algorithms.
Graphs with over 1,000,000 vertices can be partitioned in 256 parts
in under
20 seconds on a Pentium Pro personal computer.

- Provides low fill orderings!
The fill-orderings produced by METIS are significantly better than
those
produced by other widely used algorithms including multiple minimum
degree.
For many classes of problems arising in scientific computations and
linear
programming, METIS is able to reduce the storage and computational
requirements
of sparse matrix factorization, by up to an order of magnitude.
Moreover,
unlike multiple minimum degree, the elimination trees produced by
METIS are
suitable for parallel direct factorization. Furthermore, METIS is
able to
compute these orderings very fast. Matrices with over 200,000 rows
can be
reordered in just a few seconds on current generation workstations
and PCs.

===================================

q260.5.18. ParMETIS

http://www.cs.umn.edu/~metis   ParMETIS
http://www.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis   ParMETIS
ParMETIS is a Parallel Graph Partitioning and Sparse Matrix Ordering Library.
ParMETIS is an MPI-based parallel library that implements a variety of
algorithms for partitioning unstructured graphs and for computing 
fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices. ParMETIS is particularly suited 
for parallel numerical simulations involving large unstructured meshes. 
For these computations, ParMETIS dramatically reduces the time spent in 
communication by decomposing the mesh in a way that balances the load and 
minimizes the number of interface elements.

http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/chinneck/mprobe.html MProbe
MProbe is a software tool for analyzing mathematical programming models. It has special capabilities for
analyzing nonlinear functions to discern their shapes in a region of interest (i.e. whether the function is
linear or almost linear, convex or almost convex, concave or almost concave, or concave and convex).
Knowledge of function shape is crucial when developing nonlinear optimization models, or when selecting
the nonlinear solver for a nonlinear optimization problem. Determining function shape is difficult for
nonlinear functions having more than two variables. MProbe is specifically designed to operate on nonlinear
functions having many variables. MProbe also estimates the shape of a nonlinearly constrained region
(convex? nonconvex?), the objective function effect (global optimum? local optimum only?), and the
effectiveness of the constraints.

[author]:
The PGPLOT Graphics Subroutine Library is a Fortran- or C-callable,
device-independent graphics package for making simple scientific
graphs. It is intended for making graphical images of publication quality
with minimum effort on the part of the user. For most applications, the
program can be device-independent, and the output can be directed to the
appropriate device at run time.

The PGPLOT library consists of two major parts: a device-independent part
and a set of device-dependent ``device handler'' subroutines for
output on various terminals, image displays, dot-matrix printers, laser
printers, and pen plotters. Common file formats supported include
PostScript and GIF.

PGPLOT itself is written mostly in standard Fortran-77, with a few
non-standard, system-dependent subroutines. PGPLOT subroutines can
be called directly from a Fortran-77 or Fortran-90 program. A C binding
library (cpgplot) and header file (cpgplot.h) are provided that
allow PGPLOT to be called from a C or C++ program; the binding library
handles conversion between C and Fortran argument-passing
conventions.

PGPLOT has been tested with UNIX (most varieties, including Linux, SunOS,
Solaris, HPUX, AIX, and Irix) and OpenVMS operating
systems. I am unable to provide support for DOS, Windows, Windows/NT, or
MacOS, but I do distribute code provided by users for use
with these operating systems.

The Oxford BSP Toolset and Profiling system -- version 1.1

We are pleased to announce the first official release of the Oxford
BSP Toolset which conforms to the BSPlib programming library
definition. BSPlib is an SPMD communications library, and is based on
the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model of parallel computation. The
main feature of BSPlib is two modes of communication, one capturing a
BSP oriented message passing approach, and the other reflecting a
(one-sided) direct remote memory access paradigm. The core BSP library
consists of just 20 primitives. Sources are freely available by
anonymous FTP. For more information on the toolset distribution see:

http://www.bsp-worldwide.org/implmnts/oxtool/  Oxford BSP Toolset


Oxford BSPlib

Parallel programmers looking for a simple but efficient approach to
developing scalable applications software may be interested in the new
BSPlib programming library. BSPlib is an alternative to MPI and PVM, and is
based on the BSP model of parallel computation. It is already being used by
a rapidly growing community of software developers in universities and in
industry.

The BSP approach to parallel programming is applicable to all kinds of
parallel architecture: distributed memory machines, shared memory
multiprocessors, and networks of workstations. It provides a consistent,
and very general, framework within which to develop portable parallel
software for scalable architectures. One particular advantage of BSP is
that it provides _predictable_ high performance.

BSPlib can be used with C or Fortran. It supports SPMD parallelism based on
efficient one-sided communications. The core library (excluding collective
communications) consists of just 20 primitives.

The final BSPlib Definition (with C or Fortran Examples) can be obtained
from any one of the WWW sites listed below. Information on implementations
and their availability will be posted to this newsgroup in the next few days.

Xlisp-Stat Information Xlisp-Stat is an object oriented environment  
for statistical computing and dynamic graphics. Written by Professor
Luke Tierney (School of Statistics, University of Minnesota),         
Xlisp-Stat was motivated by the "S" system, with the basic principal
that an extendible system is necessary for researching new
computationally based statistical methods. Xlisp-Stat provides a set
of high-level tools to develop new dynamic graphics techniques, such
as those found in the R-code.                                      

Unlike S, Xlisp-Stat is based on Lisp, a well-established, complete
and flexible programming language. Like S, Xlisp-Stat is an
interpreted language, which is much more suited towards exploration   
than a compiled language (such as C/C++ or Pascal -- these require
lengthy recompilations to fix bugs or test simple new ideas). When
greater speed is required, a byte-code compiler can be run from inside
Xlisp-Stat. This compiler can give increase the speed of execution by
an order of magnitude.                        

The defining reference book on Xlisp-Stat is Lisp-Stat by Luke        
Tierney, 1990, J. Wiley and Sons, ISBN 0-471-50916-7. Since Xlisp-Stat
is founded on Lisp, almost any book on general Lisp programming can
help you get started.

[author]:
PARI/GP is a package which is aimed at efficient
computations in number theory, but also contains a large
number of functions unrelated to number theory. It is
somewhat related to a Computer Algebra System, but is
not really one since it treats symbolic expressions as
mathematical entities such as polynomials, series,
matrices, etc..., and not as expressions per se. However
it is often much faster than other CAS, and contains a
huge number of specific functions not found elsewhere,
essentially for use in number theory.  In particular,
and especially so in the present release, there is a
very large package for working in general algebraic
number fields.

[author]:
The symbolic manipulation program Form is a powerful tool to do large
algebraic calculations. It is an easy-to-learn language which is
complementary to large programs such as Maple and Mathematica in that
not much knowledge is built in, but Form provides you with the means
to grind quickly through large formulae. In this introductory course
the most-used commands are introduced and useful algorithms are
discussed. Many examples illustrate the text.

q520.5.8. SACLIB

ftp://ftp.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/pub/saclib  SACLIB

[Back in 1994, Andre Heck wrote]:
SACLIB is a library of C programs for computer algebra
derived from the SAC2 system. Hoon Hong was the
main instigator. Sometime early in 1990 he proposed to
translate SAC2 (which was written in the ALDES
language) into C instead of Fortran (as it had been since
1976), and he quickly wrote the required translator. The
results were rewarding in several ways. Hoon Hong, George E.
Collins and Jeremy Johnson, working together at
Ohio State University, observed a speedup by a factor of
about two in most applications and the powerful
debugging facilities associated with C became available. 

Later that year Hoon finished his doctorate and moved to
RISC, where Bruno Buchberger was writing a book on
Groebner bases and working on a set of programs to go with
it. He found that SAC2 was the only computer
algebra system in which he could write these programs
without an unacceptable sacrifice in computational
efficiency. It became apparent that for similar reasons
other researchers would benefit greatly from the
availability of a library of C programs derived from SAC2.
Subsequently Bruno did much to promote and
facilitate the preparation of the library for distribution. 

Although the translated programs were correct, they needed
to be reformatted for user consumption, a users
guide was required, and the developers had compulsions to
make some minor improvements. Jeremy Johnson
made many recent improvements to the algebraic number
algorithms and wrote the corresponding chapter of
the User Guide, among other things. Werner Krandick made
improvements to the polynomial real root
algorithms and wrote the corresponding chapter in the User
Guide. Mark Encarnacion wrote three chapters of
the User Guide and also converted the polynomial input and
output algorithms to modern notation from the
original "Fortran notation". Ana Mandache, Andreas Neubacher
and Hoon Hong all toiled long hours editing
and reformatting programs. Andreas deserves special
recognition. He initiated the writing of the manual, wrote
three chapters of the manual and two of the appendices, and
did all the required system maintenance. To
facilitate experimenting with the functions in the library,
Herbert Vielhaber implemented isac, the interactive
shell for SACLIB. He also wrote the corresponding appendix
of the manual. 

This initial version of SACLIB is just the beginning of what
is to come. The developers know how to improve
several of the programs in the current system and will do it
for subsequent versions. Some basic functionalities
are largely undeveloped in the currrent system (e.g. linear
algebra) but they will be supplied in subsequent
versions. Some more advanced functionalities (e.g.
polynomial complex roots and quantifier elimination) are
nearly ready and will be forthcoming soon. Also it is
expected that users of the system will write programs based
on the ones we distribute and offer them to other users.

q520.5.9. NTL - A Library for doing Number Theory

http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~shoup/ntl  NTL

[author]:
 * NTL is a high-performance, portable C++ library providing data structures
   and algorithms for manipulating signed, arbitrary length integers, and for
   vectors, matrices, and polynomials over the integers and over finite fields.
   
 * NTL uses state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, its code for
   polynomial arithmetic is one of the fastest available. Early versions of NTL
   have been used to set "world records" for polynomial factorization and point
   counting on elliptic curves.
   
 * NTL is written entirely in C++, and can be easily installed on just about
   any Unix platform, including PCs, and 32- and 64-bit workstations. Despite
   the fact that NTL is written in C++ and avoids assembly, NTL's performance
   is generally much better than is typical of such portable libraries.
   
 * NTL is relatively easy to use, and it provides a good environment for easily
   and quickly implementing new number-theoretic algorithms, without
   sacrificing performance.
   
 * NTL is free software that is intended for research and educational purposes
   only.

q805. Ted Brown's Work on Physics and Engineering

Ted Brown has written a set of tutorials on vectors,
dynamics, electricity and magnetism.  They are implemented
for the PC DOS environment, but he might be convinced
to write a more general version.

email: tbrown@tekotago.ac.nz

[Ted Brown]:
The tutorial, on VECTORS, is an interactive program suitable for
first year students, in that it presumes no previous knowledge of the
area.
The principal sections are on Addition and Difference of vectors by
graphical construction, and by components.
All the construction is done on the screen, with magnitudes and
angles being presented dynamically in a box, as the mouse is moved
about. Magnitudes and directions of resultants are read directly from
the screen.
Students are required to logon, and records are kept of who has been
using the program, for how long, and what their current score is.
This information is only available through an instructor module.
The program runs in Windows, resolution 640*480, 256 colours, on a
standalone machine, or on a network, and its size is around 5 or 6
Meg.
If anyone is interested in getting more details, I can be contacted
on "tbrown@tekotago.ac.nz"

I have, over the last few years written a number of physics
tutorials, in the general areas of dynamics, electricity and
magnetism, but they have all been written for DOS. If I thought there
was some interest, I would re-write them for Windows.
Ted.

q810. Gleb Beliakov's Work on Numerical Analysis

PNA is designed for the Maple V (release 2 or 3) environment.

"Practicum in Numerical Analysis (PNA)" is a set of laboratory tasks
designed to be a supplement to the course of numerical analysis. The
exercises illustrate the basic numerical methods, show their
advantages and limitations and help to understand the behavior of
numerical solutions. The interactive use of a computer permits one to
understand the properties of the algorithms to an extent impossible to
achieve reading textbooks. First, it is possible to present more
realistic examples of the usage of numerical methods (bigger systems
of equations, more iterations), and second, the students can freely
change given illustrations in order to try them out and to clarify the
behavior of the solutions. Finally, the discussed algorithms can be
used by the students in their further studies by either linking them
to bigger programs as a library or by copying the text into another
programming environment with slight changes in the syntax.

It should be noted that PNA is not a substitute for a textbook but a
complement to classical educational tools.
