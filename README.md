# Historical import of Multipack module

This is an import of code for the [Multipack module](http://pylab.sourceforge.net/multipack.html), as of version 0.70.  From the page:

> Multipack (a collection of FORTRAN routines interfaced with NumPy)
>
>  Multipackmodule 0.7  is a C-extension module along with the FORTRAN
routines it calls that provide a user-interface to the commonly used
subroutines of ODEPACK, QUADPACK, MINPACK, etc.

The code appears to be written by:

* [Travis Oliphant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Oliphant)
* [Pearu Peterson](https://sysbio.ioc.ee/people/pearu-peterson)

The repository content comes from a [Waybackmachine
archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20000929143650/http://oliphant.netpedia.net/packages/multipack-0.7.tar.gz)
of Travis Oliphant's website.  The archive was trawled on September 29 2000.

I (Matthew Brett) put this archive up for historical reference only.  The code
here appears to have been folded into the Scipy distribution.
